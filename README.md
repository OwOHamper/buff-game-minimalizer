# buff-game-minimalizer
This will automatically hide annoying popups from buff.game


There are 2 version one including the main buff window (where you buy stuff) and one without and that's because main window gets opened too.


Also keep in mind that if you want to shut down the program you have to go to task manager find the program and end it.
